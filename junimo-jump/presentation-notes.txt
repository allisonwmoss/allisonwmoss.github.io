***Remember: Turn on Do Not Disturb before beginning presentation***

Pull up the game and invite them to do the same (and to see how it looks on mobile)

I chose to create a Simon-style game
Players are shown a sequence of colors and must repeat that sequence back
I have lost many hours of my life to a game called Stardew Valley, so I decided to theme the game after that

Players are given a choice of game mode
Easy begins with one color, then two, then three
Medium begins with 3 colors, then 4, then 5
Hard begins with 5 colors, then 6, then 7
Prairie King mode begins with one color, and continues until the player loses
In every mode except Prairie King, the player will win if they successfully complete 3 rounds

Extra things I added:
Different views for landing and playing using DOM manipulation
Game mode options to adjust difficulty
A cute little animation that runs if you win
A timer runs on the player's turn and is displayed on the screen
A reset button allows the player to hard-reset the game to its neutral state and the landing view
Tried to make it look good on smaller screens

Biggest things I learned: 
Working with asynchronous functions, setTimeout, and setInterval; 
Using some tools I was already familiar with to create wireframes; 
Planning out a time-sensitive project with given requirements; 
How to organize and re-organize code in a medium-to-large project; 
How to create basic animations using DOM manipulation; 
How to have multiple “views” of a single page that appear or hide based on events.

What I still want to add: 
Adjust the player turn timeout so that it gets slightly longer each turn rather than being a static 5 seconds. 
Add ability to track scores across multiple sessions using cookies/session. 
Change the way scores are tracked for Prairie King mode, because currently I think the score box would eventually break the page if you were able to keep playing for a long time. 
Fix a bug one of my play testers found--apparently the timer can get screwed up if you play many rounds in a row

What I would do differently if I could do it over: 
I would begin by building the HTML and CSS out, then write the javascript. I found myself having to add a lot of variables and junk to my js file during the CSS phase because I realized that I wanted certain extra things to appear or hide or pop up dynamically behave differently and I needed the DOM to do that
